- Artificial intelligence deals with all the means by which we make machines act like humans.
- Machine Learning is the use of algorithms to derive insights from data to use to make intelligent decisions
- Deep Learning is a maxhine learning tool that utiliises 'neural networks' to derive insights from data for pattern recognition and problem solving.
