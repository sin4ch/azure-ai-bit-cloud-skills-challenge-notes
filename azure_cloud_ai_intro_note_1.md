# Azure AI and Cloud Skills Challenge

_What are the benefits of AI?_

They help bring:
- inclusion
- accessibility
- innovation
- sustainabilty
- optimisation
- cost effectiveness
- economic development etc

## Artificial Intelligence (AI) vs Machine Learning (ML) vs Deep Learning

- Artificial intelligence (AI) deals with all the means by which we make machines act like humans.
- Machine Learning (ML) is the use of algorithms to derive insights from data to use to make intelligent decisions
- Deep Learning is a machine learning tool that utiliises 'neural networks' to derive insights from data for pattern recognition and problem solving.

## Microsoft Azure
Microsoft Azure provides tools and services that reduce the learning curve, and allow just about anyone to build machine learning models and get APIs that can developers can "inference" into their projects.

## Machine Learning Services in Azure
The main machine learning service of Azure is known as the <u>_Azure Machine Learning designer_</u>  and is a no-code tool for implementing machine learning models on the fly.


## Azure AI services

The major AI services Azure provides include:
- Azure AI Service (a multi-service tool that can utilise multiple services as one unit. It is addressed as such i.e. no individual access to the compnent services)
- Azure AI Vision (for computer vision implementations)
- Azure AI Face (for facial recognition)
- Azure AI Language (for natural language processing (NLP) implementations) 
- Azure OpenAI (for large language model (LLM) implemetations)
- Azure AI Speech (For speech recognition, text-to-speech and vice-versa implementations)
- Azure AI Document Intelligence (utilising Read API to understand documents and forms)
